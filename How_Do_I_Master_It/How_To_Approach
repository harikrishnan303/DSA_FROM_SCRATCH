STEP 1:
  Why the DS/Algo Exists

STEP 2:
    Break the DS/Algo
     EXAMPLE:
            
            What is it?
            How it is represented in code?
            What operation it support?
            Time and Space complexity
            Are there types or variations

STEP 3:

       Watch a 20-30 minutes video related to it

STEP 4:

       Dry run and how it works

STEP 5:

       Implement the topic using class and objects

STEP 6:

       Solve 3-5 problems on easy,medium,hard on each level

STEP 7:

       Watch the solutions if cant come with the solution.

       First solve using the brute force approach and optimize it.

STEP 8:

      Take tiny notes for the problem includes the below,

          #Time and Space complexity
          #Edge cases and tricks

STEP 9:

       Revisit the problems after 5 days

STEP 10:

      #What's common across these question?
      #What logic repeating?
      #Whats the resuable pattern?

STEP 11:

      Mix and Match the topic
