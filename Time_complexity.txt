What is Time complexity?

 The rate at which the time increase with the input size rather

  Time complexity!=time taken(As the processor of the each system varies)
   
Big O Notation-Denotes every codes time complexity and space complexity

Important scenario to be noted while making best solution:

  1)Always consider the worst case scenario
  2)Apply the larger value from n to infinate
  3)Do not consider the actual value if they are linear 
  4)Ignore the small vlues if there is dominant or higher value
