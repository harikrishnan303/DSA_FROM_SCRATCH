What is Slding Window?

 The sliding window technique is an optimized approach used in array and string problems to reduce time complexity, especially when dealing with subarrays or substrings.

 Types:

    1)Fixed size
    2)Variable size

 Time and Space complexity

    1)Time-O(N),Space-O(1)
    2)Time-O(N),Space-O(1)
