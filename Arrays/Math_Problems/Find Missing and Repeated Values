Just Simple maths 

x and the y concept

find the difference of sum of first natural
then
find the sum of square of first n natural numbers


we will get two equations  x-y and x^2-y^2 equation

x^2-y^2 is (x-y)*(x+y)

so we find out the values for the x-y then divide with the (x-y)*(x+y)/(x-y)

so we get the two quations x-y and x+y so we get the value of 2x then we get the value of x is the repating number and the y is the number missing

    public int[] findMissingAndRepeatedValues(int[][] grid)

        int rows=grid.length;
        int columns=grid[0].length;

        long total=rows*columns;

        long sum=0;
        long sum_square=0;

        for(int i=0;i<rows;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<columns;j++)
            {
                sum+=(long)grid[i][j];
                sum_square+=(long)grid[i][j]*grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        long r_sum_square=(total)*(total+1)*(total*2+1)/6;
        long r_sum=(total)*(total+1)/2;

        long sum_square_diff=sum_square-r_sum_square;
        long sum_diff=sum-r_sum;

        long result_before=sum_square_diff/sum_diff;

        int x=(int)(result_before+sum_diff)/2;

        int y=(int)(x-sum_diff);

        return new int[]{x,y};
